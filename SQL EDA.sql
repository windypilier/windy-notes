-- Exploratory Data Analysis



🧾 1. What’s the order of an SQL query?
When writing a SQL query, the logical order (how SQL processes the query) is different from the order you write it. Here’s the logical execution order:

FROM → chooses the table(s)
JOIN → combines data from other tables
WHERE → filters rows
GROUP BY → groups rows for aggregation
HAVING → filters groups
SELECT → chooses the columns or calculations
ORDER BY → sorts the result
LIMIT → limits the number of rows returned




🌐 3. What’s an API?
API = Application Programming Interface

An API lets two programs talk to each other. For example:

A weather app uses a weather API to get real-time temperature

You can use a YouTube API to get video data for analysis

In short: APIs allow data or functions to be accessed programmatically from other apps or services.




📊 4. What’s a KPI?
KPI = Key Performance Indicator

A KPI is a measurable value that shows how effectively something is performing. Businesses use KPIs to track success.

Examples:

For a café: "Daily Sales" or "Customer Satisfaction Score"

For a website: "Bounce Rate" or "Conversion Rate"
